Math-Blast
==========

iOS Addition matching game (like Bejeweled/Candy Crush)

## Overview

Math-Blast is an educational, addition matching game. Much like Bejeweled, where you have to match gems of a certain color, in Math Blast, you have to match gems with values that adds up to a determined amount. For example, in level one of the game, you have to match gems that add up to 4. If you swipe across the following numbers, 2 1 0 1, you successfully captured those gems giving you points.

Scoring algorithm is as follows:

(Level target number * total gems used) * Distinct gems used

Level 1 target number starts at 4, and increments after each level.
